# Hybrid executable names for executables to be built from your sources     #
# in SRC_DIR_COMMON using Hybrid Fortran's own build system.                #
# In case you use a FRAMEWORK_MAKEFILE, you can also handle the building of #
# executables yourself - please see section                                 #
# 'Custom installation and testing' for that purpose.                       #

# Make sure to understand the following rules:                              #
# 1) Multiple executables can be specified in this variable, separated by   #
#    spaces, the list surrounded by double quotes.                          #
# 2) For every executable you should have a h90,H90,f90 or F90 file that    #
#    contains a main routine and whose filename matches exactly the name    #
#    of the executable. These main files can be placed anywhere in your     #
#    source directory or one of its subdirectories.                         #

# Add the following options, comma separated, if needed.

# DO_NOT_TOUCH_GPU_CACHE_SETTINGS:
# Adding this flag will set the GPU cache to L1preferred for each kernel.
# (Hybrid Fortran does not automate shared memory usage at the moment, so if you don't
# program shared memory specifically, this setting makes more sense).
# If you need Device capabilities below 3.x, you should add this flag because of
# incompatibilities with the HF cache setup with older CUDA versions.

# Adds debug print to the implementation.

#from the Hybrid Fortran sources. Please note that it's perfectly fine to have non-Hybrid .f, .F, .f90 or .F90 files
#in your $SRC_DIR_COMMON - however you might have a project with a build system that's too complex to be fully integrated
#into Hybrid Fortran, so this allows your build system to be spawned as a child of the Hybrid Fortran build system

# !New in Version 0.93
# For all architectures this library is created seperately in $BASEDIR/[ARCH]/$SRC_DIR_COMMON with the filename "lib${HYBRID_LIBRARY_FILENAME_POSTFIX}.a"
# All implicit and explicit interfaces defined in h90 and H90 files in $SRC_DIR_COMMON are automatically included in this library.
# Default: 'pp' stands for "parallel programming".
# This library is especially useful if your Hybrid Fortran code is part of a larger framework and you want to link your other sources against
# these interfaces. In that case you should put your Hybrid Fortran in a separate directory and reference the other framework directories
# using 'FRAMEWORK_DIRS' as well as your main Makefile using 'FRAMEWORK_MAKEFILE'.

# In CUDA 8.0 there is a strange linker behavior where it needs the object files in order of their dependencies, otherwise you get nvlink errors.
# Define the list of objects for your library below in the correct order (surround with double quotes).
# $HF_DIR/hf_bin/fort_depend is a little helper tool that prints a list of dependencies in a hybrid fortran build source folder in the correct order.
# You can use this tool and then copy the list manually here to work around this issue.

#OPTIONAL (recommended in case you use a configure script. Specify the path of a file that's always touched by configure, relative to the projects root directory.
#          The Hybrid Fortran build system will automatically call ./configure if this file doesn't exist yet. Note: It's advisable to put files needed by your framework compilation into

# !New in Version 0.95
#OPTIONAL, can be used to specify parameters for the test system that can be passed to the accuracy test. The following parameters can be used:
#  -b BYTES, --bytesPerValue=BYTES  (defaults to 8, relevant only if you use .DAT files)
#  -r [big/little/auto], --readEndian=[big/little/auto] (defaults to little, relevant only if you use .DAT files; auto is slower and experimental but tries to deted endianness automatically)
#  -e EPS, --epsilon=EPS (Throw an error if at any point the error becomes higher than EPS. Defaults to 1E-9.)
ACCURACY_TEST_PARAMETERS=""

# !New in Version 0.9
#OPTIONAL, can be used to have the 'make tests' interface with custom executables - for example when you need to run multiple executables for your
#tests, you can create a run-script in a test-subdirectory together with all the input data you need and you can specify these script paths using TEST_EXECUTABLES.
#Specify relative to the project's root directory, separate with spaces and surround the list with double quotes.
# ! your scripts specified here should take one input argument 'ARCH' and call your executables with _$ARCH postfix in the filename !
# Note: The output of automatic tests looks best if you use STDOUT for timing outputs and STDERR for everything else. Return codes other than 0 will result in the
# test failing - which can be very useful - so it is advisable to return error codes generated in your codebase.
TEST_EXECUTABLES=""

# !New in Version 0.9
#OPTIONAL, can be used to specify the naming pattern of files that are being created by your tests, using bash syntax, as seen from the respective executable's directory.
#As an example, if your script is placed in tests/my_test/my_run_script.sh and the output is files of the form tests/my_test/my_output*, specify "my_output*" here.
#If you have multiple test executables, separate the output files with spaces and surround the list with double quotes.
#This will be used by the Hybrid Fortran test framework to pick up output files and compare them to reference files that you provide in a ref.tar.gz in the
#test executable's directory. Compatible with simple .dat files as well as netcdf. Please refer to the manual for more information.
